Description: CMEA is a tool for cell morphology enrichment analysis and link transcriptomic alterations with cell morphological phenotypes. In our approach we (1) map the transcriptomic profile of a query against the L1000 LINCS repository, (2) create a gene set repository for cell morphological features (CM), (3) identify the top CMs associated with alterations and analyze their direction of regulation, and (4) model a regulatory network of cell morphological phenotypes.
